function [ hitPoints ] = extractPoints( scanData )
% Take in scan data output from loadScanData and find the points
% corresponding to hit points on the lines of the calibration marker
% Inputs:

% Outputs:
%   hitPoints  <- 3 pairs of points [x1 x2; x3 x4; x5 x6] indicating
%                   endpoints of extracted lines of calibration target
